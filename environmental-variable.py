"""Here we don't set the env var yet
python main.py

ðŸ’¬ As we didn't set the env var, we get the default value

Hello World from Python

ðŸ’¬ But if we create an environment variable first
export MY_NAME="Wade Wilson"

ðŸ’¬ And then call the program again
python main.py

ðŸ’¬ Now it can read the environment variable

Hello Wade Wilson from Python"""
